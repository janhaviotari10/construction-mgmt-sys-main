# Construction Management System 🏗️

A full-stack construction management system built with **React** (frontend) and **Python** (backend) for estimating construction costs, managing projects, meetings, and documentation — integrated with a machine learning model for cost prediction.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (JSX, CSS)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or similar)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Random Forest Regression
- **Data**: CSV / JSON
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S14BF/construction-mgmt-sys.git
cd construction-mgmt-sys
````

---

### 2. Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd Dashboard
npm install
npm start
```

Runs the React app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

### 3. Backend Setup (Python)

```bash
cd backend
# If using virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # or source venv/bin/activate on Linux/macOS

pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

Runs backend server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

> 🔁 Make sure to connect frontend and backend URLs in your Axios or fetch API calls.

Let me know if:
- You're using Flask or FastAPI, I’ll tweak that.
- You want me to write a `requirements.txt` for the backend based on your code.
- You want badge shields (build status, license, etc.).
